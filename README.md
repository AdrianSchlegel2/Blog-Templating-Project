# Blog Templating Project
 A website that hosts itself over your own PC. The website is made to host blogs and the blogs can be either be held in a list like this: [{id:x, {body: x, title: x, subtitle:x}}], or you can load the data in the same format from an API, as I have done it. The website itself is hosted using the webframework: **Flask** and a combination of **HTML** and **CSS**. To host the website yourself just download the source code, run it and click on the link you get. *It should be something like http://156.0.0.3:7000*
 
 *Reminder: If you want to use the program, you might want to enter your own / company name at the footer of the HTML documents where it says my name at the moment*
